  <h1>How to do a Body Scan Meditation</h1>
  <hr />

  <img src="assets/images/Mindfulness-retreat-1kom-geo.jpg" alt="body-scan-meditation-group">
  <br><br>
  <p><strong>Body scan</strong>, a meditative practice that involves mindfully scanning your body for sensations of
    pain, tension, or anything out of the ordinary.</p>
  <p>
    Developing greater awareness of bodily sensations can help you feel more connected to your physical self and gain
    greater insight into potential causes of unwanted feelings.
  </p>
  <p>
    This knowledge can make it easier to address what’s wrong, leading to improved wellness in body and mind.
  </p>

  <h4>Why it's worth trying?</h4>
  <p>
    Experts have found evidence to suggest meditation can promote physical and emotional wellness in multiple ways, such
    as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>improved sleep</li>
    <li>anxiety and stress relief</li>
    <li>greater self-awareness</li>
    <li>increased self-compassion</li>
    <li>reduced pain</li>
    <li>reduced cravings</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>How to get started</h3>
    <p>
      You can think of a body scan as a mental X-ray that slowly travels across your body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s how to give it a try:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Get cozy</b>. Start by getting comfortable. Lie down or sit in a position that allows you to stretch your
        limbs easily.</li>
      <li><b>Choose where to start</b>. Begin anywhere you like — left hand, left foot, right hand, right foot, the top
        of your head. Focus on that spot as you continue breathing slowly and deeply.</li>
      <li><b>Pay attention</b>. Open your awareness to sensations of pain, tension, discomfort, or anything out of the
        ordinary.</li>
      <li><b>Go slow</b>. Spend anywhere from 20 seconds to 1 minute observing these sensations.</li>
      <li><b>Acknowledge</b>. If you begin to notice pain and discomfort, acknowledge and sit with any emotions these
        sensations bring up. Accept them without criticism. For example, if you feel frustrated and angry, don’t judge
        yourself for these emotions. Notice them and let them pass.</li>
      <li><b>Breathe</b>. Continue breathing, imagining the pain and tension decreasing with each breath.</li>
      <li><b>Release</b>. Slowly release your mental awareness on that specific part of your body and redirect it to
        your next area of focus. Some people find it helpful to imagine releasing one body part as they breathe out and
        moving on to the next as they breathe in.</li>
      <li><b>Move along</b>. Continue the exercise along your body in a way that makes sense to you, whether you move
        from top to bottom or up one side and down the other.</li>
      <li><b>Note drifting thoughts</b>. As you continue to scan across your body, note when your thoughts begin to
        drift. This will happen probably more than once, so don’t worry. You haven’t failed, and you can easily get your
        thoughts back on track. Just gently return your awareness to where you left off scanning.</li>
      <li><b>Visualize and breathe</b>. Once you finish scanning parts of your body, let your awareness travel across
        your body. Visualize this as liquid filling a mold. Continue inhaling and exhaling slowly as you sit with this
        awareness of your whole body for several seconds.</li>
      <li><b>Come back</b>. Slowly release your focus and bring your attention back to your surroundings.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Make it a habit</h3>
    <p>You may notice some improvement immediately. Then again, the body scan might not seem to have any effect at all.
      It could also awaken your awareness around discomfort, making it seem worse.</p>
    <p>
      This might put you off meditation entirely, but try to commit to a few more attempts to see if things improve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plenty of people don’t enjoy meditation or notice any benefits the first few times they try it. But experts
      suggest it’s still worth meditating regularly, even if you don’t love it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consistent meditation can lead to positive changes in your brain, including:

    <ul>
      <li>improved focus</li>
      <li>increased compassion and other positive emotions
      </li>
      <li>greater ability to cope with unwanted emotions
      </li>

    </ul>
    <p>
      If it helps, you can think of meditation as an exercise for your brain. Maybe you don’t feel like working up a
      sweat all the time, especially if you’ve already had a rough day. But once you get going, your workout generally
      becomes easier, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      When you finish exercising, you might even feel pretty good, and keeping up an exercise routine usually makes it
      easier over time.
    </p>

    <h3>Beginner tip</h3>
    <p>If a body scan or any type of <em>meditation</em> doesn’t seem to do much for you the first time, try not to get
      discouraged. It can take some time to get used to meditation, and that’s completely normal.</p>
