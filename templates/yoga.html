  <h1>What "<em>yoga</em>" means?</h1>

  <br>
  <p><strong>Yoga</strong> is a practice to conect mind, breathing, and body.<br />
    This technique uses postures, breathing exercises and meditation to improve well-being and health</p>
  <p>The literal translation of the word “yoga” from Sanskrit (which is recognized as the original language of yoga) is
    “union”. </p>
  <p>Yoga began in India and has been around for about 5,000 years.</p>
  <p>It is yoga as we know it today, “<i>We define it as bringing together the mind and the body by use of the
      breath.</i>”</p>

  <h2 id="benefits">Why should we all practice Yoga?</h2>
  <p>Whether for fitness, mental space, or simply an excuse to buy more Lycra – yoga has found its way into our lives.
    “Yoga is the first and most successful product of globalisation,” says Stefanie Syman, the Brooklyn-based author of
    The Subtle Body: The Story of Yoga in America. </p>
  <p>
    In 2018, yoga was reported to be the fourth fastest growing industry in the US
    <br />
    Globally, more than 300 million people now practise yoga.

    <h3>Types of Yoga</h3>
    <p>There are many different <strong>types of yoga</strong> with different goals, choose th one suits you better.</p>
    <h4>ANUSARA</h4>
    <p>Developed by American yogi John Friend in 1997, Anusara yoga is a relative newcomer to the yoga world. Based on
      the belief that we’re all filled with an intrinsic goodness, <em>Anusara</em> seeks to use the physical practice
      of yoga to help students open their hearts, experience grace, and let their inner goodness shine through. Classes,
      which are specifically sequenced by the teacher to explore one of Friend's Universal Principles of Alignment, are
      rigorous for the body and the mind.</p>
    <h4>ASHTANGA</h4>
    <p>Ashtanga is based on ancient yoga teachings, but it was popularized and brought to the West by K. Pattabhi Jois
      (pronounced "pah-tah-bee joyce") in the 1970s. It's a rigorous style of yoga that follows a specific sequence of
      postures and is similar to vinyasa yoga, as each style links every movement to a breath. The difference is that
      <em>Ashtanga</em> always performs the exact same poses in the exact same order. This is a sweaty, physically
      demanding practice, so make sure to bring your trusty yoga mat towel.</p>
    <h4>KUNDALINI YOGA</h4>
    <p>This is a more spiritual approach and encourages meditation. It is not physically demanding, due to the postures
      being simple as it is more focused on clearing the mind and finding inner peace.
      <br />This type of yoga is ideal for those who seek to escape from stress and reconnect with their inner self. It
      strengthens the nervous system and purifies the blood.
    </p>
    <h4>BIKRAM</h4>
    <p>About 30 years ago, Bikram Choudhury developed this school of yoga where classes are held in artificially heated
      rooms. In a Bikram class, you will sweat like never before as you work your way through a series of 26 poses. Like
      Ashtanga, a <em>Bikram</em>Bikram class always follows the same sequence, although a Bikram sequence is different
      from an ashtanga sequence. Bikram is somewhat controversial, as Choudhury trademarked his sequence and has sued
      studios who call themselves Bikram, but don't teach the poses exactly the way he says they should. It’s also
      wildly popular, making it one of the easiest classes to find. Due to the heated conditions of the studio, don't
      forget to bring a water bottle!</p>
    <h4>HATHA</h4>
    <p>Hatha yoga is a generic term that refers to any type of yoga that teaches physical postures. Nearly every type of
      yoga class taught in the West is Hatha yoga. When a class is marketed as Hatha, it generally means that you will
      get a gentle introduction to the most basic yoga postures. You probably won't work up a sweat in a <em>hatha</em>
      yoga class, but you should end up leaving class feeling longer, looser, and more relaxed.</p>
    <h4>HOT YOGA</h4>
    <p>Largely the same thing as Bikram. Generally, the only difference between Bikram and hot yoga is that the hot yoga
      studio deviates from Bikram's sequence in some small way, and so they must call themselves by another name. The
      room will be heated and you will sweat buckets, so check out our mats and accessories specifically designed for
      <em>hot yoga</em> classes. </p>
    <h4> IYENGAR</h4>
    <p>Iyengar yoga was developed and popularized by B.K.S. Iyengar (pronounced "eye-yen-gar"). Iyengar is a very
      meticulous style of yoga, with utmost attention paid to finding the proper alignment in a pose. In order to help
      each student find the proper alignment, an Iyengar studio will stock a wide array of yoga props — blocks,
      blankets, straps, chairs and bolsters are all common. There isn't a lot of jumping around in Iyengar classes, so
      you won't get your heart rate up, but you'll be amazed to discover how physically and mentally challenging it is
      to stay put. Iyengar teachers must undergo a comprehensive training — if you have an injury or chronic condition,
      <em>Iyengar</em> is probably your best choice to ensure you get the knowledgeable instruction you need. For a
      speedier recovery from an injury or to relieve sore, tight muscles, check out our line of recover products. </p>
    <h4>RESTORATIVE</h4>
    <p>Restorative yoga is a delicious way to relax and soothe frayed nerves. Also described as yin yoga,
      <em>restorative</em> classes use bolsters, blankets, and blocks to prop students into passive poses so the body
      can experience the benefits of a pose without having to exert any effort. A good restorative class is more
      rejuvenating than a nap. Studios and gyms often offer them on Friday nights, when just about everyone could use
      some profound rest.</p>
    <h4>VINYASA</h4>
    <p> Vinyasa classes are known for their fluid, movement-intensive practices. <em>Vinyasa</em> teachers sequence
      their classes to smoothly transition from pose to pose, with the intention of linking breath to movement, and
      often play music to keep things lively. The intensity of the practice is similar to Ashtanga, but no two vinyasa
      classes are the same. If you hate routine and love to test your physical limits, vinyasa may be just your ticket.

    <h2>HATHA YOGA</h2>
    <p>Hatha yoga is the <b>most popular</b> and the one offered in most gyms. It covers all the traditional aspects of
      yoga such as body awareness, breathing and meditation.
      <br>
      This type of yoga is ideal for people starting for the first time, since the general postures are basic, and the
      class progresses in a slow progressive manner. The asanas(<i>poses</i>) are simple with the aim of teaching you
      how to breathe, relax and meditate during the classes.
