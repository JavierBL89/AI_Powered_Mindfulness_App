3. The Solution: Few Epochs & Low Learning Rate

**Epochs**
An epoch refers to how many times the model processes your entire dataset during training.
Fewer epochs (e.g., 2-5) ensure the model learns just enough to incorporate your fine-tuning data without overfitting or overwriting its pretrained knowledge.


**Learning Rate**
The learning rate controls how much the model adjusts its weights during training.
A low learning rate (e.g., 5e-5 or 3e-5) ensures that the model:
Makes small, gradual adjustments.
Adapts to your dataset without significantly altering its pretrained parameters.



5. Benefits of This Approach
Preserves Pretrained Knowledge: The model retains its general conversational and linguistic abilities.
Specializes on Your Dataset: It learns to prioritize your specific domain (e.g., mindfulness content).
Prevents Overfitting: The model doesnâ€™t become overly biased toward your dataset, making it less likely to perform poorly on general queries.
